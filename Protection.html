    <h1>Protection of Child Labor</h1>
    <p>Working towards a future where every child enjoys safety, education, and dignity</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      Child labor remains a pressing global issue, despite significant progress in recent decades.
      It refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood,
      potential, and dignity, and that is harmful to their physical and mental development.
      According to the <strong>International Labour Organization (ILO)</strong>, around
      <strong>152 million children</strong> are still engaged in child labor, with almost half of them in hazardous work.
    </p>
        <h2>Reasons for Child Labor:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> Families living in poverty often rely on children to supplement household income.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of Education:</strong> Limited access to quality education forces children into the workforce.</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural Practices:</strong> Some cultures prioritize economic contributions from children over their education and well-being.</li>
      <li><strong>Supply Chains:</strong> Global supply chains may exploit child labor due to demand for cheap and flexible labor.</li>
    </ul>

       
    <h2>Solutions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>International Cooperation:</strong> Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and international organizations like the ILO is crucial for sharing best practices and resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Corporate Responsibility:</strong> Companies should implement and enforce supply chain policies that prohibit child labor and support ethical sourcing.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Engaging communities in dialogue and providing alternative income-generating opportunities can reduce reliance on child labor.</li>
      <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Empowering children and their families through skills training and access to credit can break the cycle of poverty.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
      While progress has been made, eradicating child labor requires sustained commitment from all stakeholders.
      Governments, businesses, communities, and individuals must work together to create a world where every child
      can enjoy their right to education, play, and a safe childhood. By investing in education, enforcing laws,
      and promoting sustainable development, we can build a future where child labor is a thing of the past.
