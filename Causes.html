        <h1>Causes & Effects of Child Labor</h1>
    <p>Understanding the deep-rooted causes and far-reaching consequences of child labor</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p><strong>Child labor</strong> persists as a complex global issue with deep-rooted causes and far-reaching effects on children, families, communities, and societies. Understanding the underlying factors contributing to child labor and its consequences is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat this phenomenon.</p>

    <h2>Causes of Child Labor:</h2>
    <p><strong>Poverty:</strong> Economic hardship is perhaps the most significant driver of child labor. Families living in poverty often rely on the income earned by children to supplement household earnings and meet basic needs.</p>
    <p><strong>Lack of Access to Education:</strong> Limited access to quality education, including barriers such as school fees, lack of nearby schools, and poor infrastructure, forces children out of the classroom and into the workforce.</p>
    <p><strong>Cultural and Social Norms:</strong> In some societies, there are cultural norms that prioritize children's economic contributions over their right to education and protection. This includes expectations that children will contribute to family livelihoods from a young age.</p>
    <p><strong>Demand for Cheap Labor:</strong> Industries and businesses seeking to minimize production costs may exploit child labor for its affordability, flexibility, and willingness to work under harsh conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>Urbanization and Migration:</strong> Rural-urban migration often leads to overcrowded urban centers where families struggle to make ends meet. Children from migrant families may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation in informal sectors.</p>
    <p><strong>Conflict and Crisis:</strong> During times of conflict, displacement, or humanitarian crises, children are at increased risk of being recruited into armed groups, trafficked, or forced into hazardous work.</p>

    <h2>Effects of Child Labor:</h2>
    <p><strong>Education Deprivation:</strong> Child labor deprives children of their right to education, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting their future prospects. Without education, children are less likely to escape poverty as adults.</p>
    <p><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Many child laborers work in hazardous conditions, exposing them to physical injuries, illnesses from exposure to toxic substances, and long-term health problems. They often lack access to healthcare and proper nutrition.</p>
    <p><strong>Psychological Impact:</strong> Child labor can lead to psychological distress, anxiety, and trauma. Children may experience feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, and a loss of childhood innocence.</p>
    <p><strong>Social Development:</strong> Working at a young age robs children of opportunities to socialize, play, and develop social skills critical for their emotional and cognitive development.</p>
    <p><strong>Cycle of Poverty:</strong> Rather than alleviating poverty, child labor often perpetuates it by trapping children in low-wage, unskilled work with limited prospects for advancement.</p>
    <p><strong>Inter-generational Impact:</strong> Children who experience child labor are more likely to perpetuate the cycle by entering the workforce prematurely as adults, perpetuating poverty and limiting economic development.</p>
